Following the 'time honored tradition'

To anyone who reads this...why are you wasting your time here? Please go look at something respectable. 
Still reading? Well, that's unfortunate, but allow me to introduce myself. My name is Kevin. I've been playing guitar for nearly 22 years. I've been playing for larger churches in the Chicagoland area (as well as camps and conferences) for the past 11 years. I've been playing guitar at a professional level for the past 8 years (it started out semi-professional and grew from there). Most recently I was employed by a church called Willow Creek. After many years riding the ups and downs of being a professional musician I've decided to make a career change into Front-End Web Development. I've always been facinated by code and watching people code. My goal is to launch a career that will allow me to grow over time and that is both fun and challeging. 
This leads us to this document. I've heard github is the place to be if you're looking to go into web development. And so I am following the tutorial and learning how this thang works. 
Here's to hoping my life looks different this time next year. 
Ps. Did you seriously read all that crap? Go find something better to do with your time.
